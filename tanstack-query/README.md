## Tanstack Query

TanStack Query, previously known as React Query, is a popular library used in React applications for managing server state and handling asynchronous data fetching. It provides a set of hooks that simplify the process of fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating data in a React app.

It is `Framework Agnostic` which means it is not limited to React, it has been expanded to support other frameworks and libraries, but its most common use is within React applications.
