## Design Patterns

Design Patterns are common solutions and best practices used to structure code efficiently, making it more maintainable, resuable and scalable.

### Layout Components (Split Screen, List Data and Modal)

Layout components are strategies for organising and composing components that manage the layout structure of a project. The components typically control the positioning and arrangement of child elements within a page, acting as containers for other UI elements or sections.

Container Components are responsible for loading and managing data for their child components. This pattern is often used in conjunction with Presentational Components to keep UI more modular and maintainable.
